I built this site with *Next.js*, *Tailwind CSS*, and *TypeScript*.

This site is an instrument! I use `AudioContext` to play pitches, with frequencies computed based on cursor position and musical-scale ratios.

I'm not really a web developer, but I enjoy building fun websites. To keep it simple, I wrote the animations in TypeScript and CSS.
